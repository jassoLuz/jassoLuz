- 👋 Hi, I’m @jassoLuz
- 👀 I’m interested in software development, backend and frontend. I am not fullstack developer :(
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ruby, python, node.js, mongodb, etc
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple exercises for each language I just mentioned and some others
- I consider myself good in databases and backend code
